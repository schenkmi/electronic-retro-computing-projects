## Interactive BOM

For assembling and BOM list, see the [interactive bom](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwack/C64C-250469-KiCAD-Replica/main/bom/ibom.html).
The .csv file includes also additional parts, like fuse clips and ic sockets.

## Discrepancies in Layout and Schematics

Many inconsistencies were found in the schematics and layout.

- Inputs of 4066 in U18 and U21 are named differently.
- Global label INTRES near U6, a INTRES net is crossing, but there is no junction.
- C8 in the schematics is the same as C2 in the layout.
- 9VAC global label seems to point the wrong direction.
- R16 is anonymous in the schematic.
- Power Switch symbols have no reference number and no pin numbers.
- kicad labels will not have slash inside ~{}, but will have them in symbol pin names.
- C59 is missing its reference in the schematics. Schematics says it is C19.
- CASS_RD RP3 pin 8 is actually RP5 pin 8.
- C70 at U2 is actually C30.
- C18 in the schematic is actually C48 on the pcb.
- RP4 pin 9 was not marked with a number in the schematic.
- C45 in the schematic is C65 in the layout.
- Crystal Y1 in the schematics doesn't show the shield grounding and its connection.
- EXT_RESET at the serial port is called EXTRES at U22.
- Diode arrays DA1-4 in the layout was not in the schematics.

Other:
- PB0..7 and PA2 in the schematic share the same net names between to the CIA ICs.

## Change log

- Rev 1.0 (2023-02-21)
This was the prototype shown in the video series.

- Rev 1.1 (2023-05-17)
  - Adjusted position of mounting holes, and power switch.
  - Joystick ports: Mechanical mounting holes changed to plated.
  - Crystal: vias changed to solder pads for grounding.
