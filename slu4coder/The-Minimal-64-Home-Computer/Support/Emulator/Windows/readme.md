# Emulator (Win64 .exe)

On some graphic cards, 60Hz VSYNC is not detected correctly. In that case, set the frame rate manually to 60Hz from within your graphic card's control center.

Please note that the source code of the Windows/OpenGL version of the emulator (~5400 lines of code) is not available for download. If you are interested in the - amazingly simple - general principle of the emulator, please refer to the more readable but otherwise functionally identical Java/Processing version (~800 lines of code).
