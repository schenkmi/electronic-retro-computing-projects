# Min Is Not Python...
... but an interpreted computer language I develop for fun and as a learning experience, mainly to deploy it on my DIY 'Minimal UART CPU' project and also on my latest 'Minimal 64 Home Computer'.

This educational version of Min is written in 230 lines of Python code. Visit my YouTube channel for more information: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXYQcMpUBT3aaQKfmAVJNow

USAGE: python min.py blocks.min

What you get:

o Python-style indentation

o if-elif-else, while-break, print, def-return

o str(), input(), int(), len(), key(), random()

o string and integer data types

o local and global variables and 1-dimensional arrays

o functions with parameters and C-style referencing

o optional : and ; syntax sugar

o .. slicing operator replacing :

o 'A' replacing ord("A")


Have fun!
