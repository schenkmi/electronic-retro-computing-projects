Revision 1.6 ("Redux") is software-compatible to revision 1.5. The schematics and the microcode, however, have been optimized for build-simplicity on breadboards. Only 39 ICs are being used, compared to the 47 ICs of revision 1.5.

NEW: Minimal 'Beast Mode' can run at up to 8.3MHz clock speed.

ONLY USE HIGH-QUALITY BREADBOARDS FOR YOUR BUILD!
