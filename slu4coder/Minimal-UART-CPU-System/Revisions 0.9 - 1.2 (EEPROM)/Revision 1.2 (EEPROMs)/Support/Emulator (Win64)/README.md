# Legacy Educational Version of the 'Minimal-UART-CPU Emulator' Revision 1.2

Files I've used in my educational YouTube video about how to emulate a 'Minimal UART CPU System' cycle-exactly and in real-time in under 250 lines of C++ code.

I write a cycle exact real-time emulator for a simple CPU system in C++ in about 250 lines of code and briefly explain some of my concepts along the way. Update: The instruction set is now compatible with the Minimal UART Computer (FLASH Edition).
