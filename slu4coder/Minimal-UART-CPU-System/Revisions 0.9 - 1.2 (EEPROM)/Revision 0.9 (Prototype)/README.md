# Minimalistic 8-Bit CPU Revision 0.9 (First Breadboard Prototype)

This a legacy version! Latest revision: https://github.com/slu4coder/Minimal-UART-CPU-System

Hi there! You have made it to my repo where I keep track of the files relevant to my 'Minimal 8-Bit Computer' design.
This includes:

- KiCad schematics
- Control logic microcode (EEPROM data)
- Arduino sketches (VGA card and clock / RAM upload)
- Assember written in C++ (Win64 only)
- Emulator written in C++/OpenGL (Win64 only)
- Operating system 'MinOS' (memory monitor aka WOZMON, absolute loader, bootstrap loader, save routine, memory filler, help screen, etc.)
- Software projects (32-bit math, displaying numbers in HEX / DEC, PONG and TETRIS clones I've written for fun, etc.)

Cheers,
