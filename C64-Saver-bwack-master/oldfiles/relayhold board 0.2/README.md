# The C64 Saver 2 relay hold board

The addon board is for many hard to make. I was thinking, what about making a board that doesn't need to be programmed, that can cut 9VAC, and optionally keep the outputs disabled even if the fault goes away. This circuit is it. It was more of an experimental circuit. I've therefor archived it here.
