# KIM-1 Replica

## Introduction

Welcome to the MOS KIM-1 reproduction project repository, where you will find what aims to be a faithful replica of the MOS KIM-1 computer, in particular a revision "D" PCB, based on photos and information gathered from various sources on the internet. With minimal modifications, later revisions should be easy to reproduce as well.

The KIM-1 was a single-board computer released in 1976 by MOS Technology, later acquired by Commodore, as a demonstrator of the capabilities of the recently released 6502 microprocessor.

## About

This recreation has been an excruciating process using entirely free software: Inkscape, Kicad and Freecad.

First, a high resolution image of a KIM-1 was used as a template in Inkscape. The image was resized to scale using the IC footprints as a reference. Then, the rest of the footprints were placed and the tracks were traced using b√©zier curves. I used a layer for each type graphic components (footprints, tracks, copper zones, typography, ...)

The logo was created from the MOS logo, adding the commodore name with the [Eurostile Extended 2 Bold font](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/eurostile-extended-2-bold).

Component references where placed with the [Futura STD Bold font](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Futura-Std-Bold). The [Arial-like Aria font](https://fontsgeek.com/aria_1-font) was used for other typography.

The inkscape image was imported from Kicad to an user layer and used as a template for placing the footprints. Then, the image with the tracks was imported to the copper layer and converted to kicad tracks, so it was possible to check the pcb against the schematic.

The logo and the typography were converted to footprints using the svg2shenzhen plugin.

This is the end result:

The replica has been successfully built and tested. Here is a picture of the KIM-1 working with [my dual 6530-6532 adapter](https://github.com/eduardocasino/kim-1-dual-6532-adapter) and [my work-in-progress kim-1 keypad](https://github.com/eduardocasino/kim-1-keypad):

## Building

[Paul Sajna](https://github.com/sajattack) has created an [Octopart BOM](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/09w2sZzv), with direct distributor links, to ease the sourcing of the components. Take into account that there are some obsolete parts that are no longer available, so you'll have to look on eBay or Aliexpress for them. Just be careful with counterfeits!
