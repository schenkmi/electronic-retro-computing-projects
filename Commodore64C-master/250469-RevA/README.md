## Status

I am quite confident that the schematic is stable and bug-free.

**Good News!** I acquired a spare motherboard that matches exactly this revision.
With this example in my hand, I corrected all dimensional errors in the PCB.
I also placed with great precision all the external connectors.
Now work on routing the PCB can begin!
