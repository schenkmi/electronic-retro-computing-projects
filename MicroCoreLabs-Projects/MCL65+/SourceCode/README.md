Source code for 6502 emulations which can be used on the MCL65+


Variations:

    Generic_6502 - Standard MOS 6502 emulator which runs on a Teensy 4.1 and can be used as a 6502 drop-in replacment and can be accelerated
	AppleII_Plus - Supports Apple II+ address ranges and allows acceleration mode changes with keystrokes
	MCL65_Fast   - Non 6502 emulator. Used to run compiled C code on the Teensy and have access to the 6502 local bus
	Experimental - Apple II+ version with attempt at bank switching. Diagnostic tests detect the banked RAM/ROM but applications lock up
