  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Timing:3402 - The Clock Modifying COMP, SPARTAN6PLL/dcm_sp_inst, has the attribute CLK_FEEDBACK set to NONE.  No phase relationship
   exists between the input and output clocks of this Clock Modifying COMP. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using
   FROM/TO constraints.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network EU_CORE/EU4Kx32_i/douta<31> has no load.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:1861 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp SPARTAN6PLL/dcm_sp_inst,
   consult the device Data Sheet.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   1 block(s) removed
   4 block(s) optimized away
   3 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "EU_CORE/EU4Kx32_i/douta<31>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal
"EU_CORE/EU4Kx32_i/U0/xst_blk_mem_generator/gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.
cstr/ramloop[7].ram.ram_douta<8>" is sourceless and has been removed.
 Sourceless block
"EU_CORE/EU4Kx32_i/U0/xst_blk_mem_generator/gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.
cstr/has_mux_a.A/Mmux_dout_mux251" (ROM) removed.
The signal
"EU_CORE/EU4Kx32_i/U0/xst_blk_mem_generator/gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.
cstr/ramloop[6].ram.ram_douta<8>" is sourceless and has been removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		EU_CORE/EU4Kx32_i/XST_GND
VCC 		EU_CORE/EU4Kx32_i/XST_VCC
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
