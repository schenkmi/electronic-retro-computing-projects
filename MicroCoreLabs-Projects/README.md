Boards:

    MCL6809  -  Motorola 6809E emulator which runs on a Teensy 4.1 and can be used as a drop-in replacment 
    MCLZ8    -  Zilog Z80 emulator which runs on a Teensy 4.1 and can be used as a drop-in replacment 
    MCL86+   -  Intel 8088 emulator which runs on a Teensy 4.1 and can be used as a drop-in replacment 
    MCL86jr  -  IBMPCjr Accelerator which boosts performance to IBM PC/AT speed
    MCL65+   -  MOS 6502 emulator which runs on a Teensy 4.1 and can be used as a 6502 drop-in replacment
    MCL64    -  MOS 6510 emulator which runs on a Teensy 4.1 and can be used as a drop-in replacment in the Commodore 64
    MCL68+   -  Motorola 68000 emulator which runs on a Teensy 4.1 and can be used as a drop-in replacment 

    
Emulated Processors:

    MCL68  - Motorola 68000 Emulator written in C
    RISCV  - Simple and compact RISC-V RS32I implementation written in C
    MCL65  - MOS 6502 written in C


Microsequencer-based processors: 

    MCL65 - MOS 6502 
    MCL51 - Intel 8051
    MCL86 - Intel 8086/8088
    
Other processors:

    MCLR5 - Quad-Issue Superscalar RISCV
    Lockstep Quad Modular Redundant System 
    
Misc:

    Wheelwriter  - FPGA based Printer Option for the IBM Wheelwriter 5
    Wheelwriter2 - Arduino Leonardo based Printer Option for the IBM Wheelwriter 5
    Brother Typewriter - Arduino Leonardo converts Serial RX to a Brother Word Processor
    EPROM Emulator - Small PCB which uses Teensy 4.0 to emulate up a 64KB 27C512 EPROM
    MCL64_Tester - Extensive, menu-based, tests for the Commodore 64 motherboard
    MCLZ8 TRS-80 Emulator - Emulates a TRS-80 Model 1 inside of a Teensy microcontroller board
    MCL_TRS_NABU - Emulates a TRS-80 Model 1 using the MCLZ8 which runs inside of a NABU Personal Computer
    Turbo NABU - Uses the MCLZ8 to run simple C code on the Teensy to control the motherboard resources of the NABU Computer
    MDA Video - Project which uses an Arty Z7-20 SOC FPGA board to diaplay BMP images to an MDA display
    IBMPC_68000 - Uses the MCL86+ board to emulate a Motorola 68000 which runs inside of an IBM PC as-if they selected this processor in 1981
    MCL65_Apple1 - Converts an Apple II into an Appke 1 by emulating the BIOS PROMs, system memory, and performing some I/O conversion
