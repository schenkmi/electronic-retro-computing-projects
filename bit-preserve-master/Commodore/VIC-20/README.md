# Commodore VIC-20 Schematic

The schematic for the Commodore VIC-20 (251027-01 Rev D) was taken from the schematics on zimmers.net and converted into KiCad (Version 5.12)


I have also created KiCad footprints and symbols for the custom components.
Make sure you also have the latest KiCAD symbol library as I have also added the 6502 to the library.
