# Commodore Plus 4 Schematic and PCB

The schematic for the Commodore Plus4 (314001-04) was taken from the schematics on zimmers.net and converted into KiCad (Version 5.12)

* Main schematic 
* RF Modulator (rfmodulator.sch)

The PCB (Rev 310162 Rev D) layout (components only) has also been completed and 3D parts populated. The 3D parts are not 100% accurate and should only be used as eye candy.Work still needs to be completed on the track layout but this will take a lot of time to get it to match the original PCB

I have also created KiCad footprints and symbols for the custom components.
