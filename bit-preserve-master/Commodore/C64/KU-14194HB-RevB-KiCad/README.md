The KU14194HB C64 Motherboard schematics and layout. Retraced in and imported from SprintLayout.
This less common board was an interim board produced in 1982, and wasproduced between the 326298 (1982) and 250407 (1983).

# Original bodges

This KiCad design is a replica. It includes the mistakes that Commodore made. It is necessary to cut a trace above R37 on the bottom side, and add a 1K resistor from R37 and up to a via. See the images folder to where to cut and add a resistor.
Piggyback a 100nF capacitor over CR1. Notice how the main crystal oscillator Y1 body is grounded with a wire.
