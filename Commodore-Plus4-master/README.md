# Commodore Plus 4 Schematic and PCB

The schematic for the Commodore Plus 4 (310162 Rev D) was taken from the Plus 4 Service Manual 314001-04 (1984 Oct) and converted into KiCad (Version 5.10)



I have also created KiCad footprints and symbols for the custom components as well as some 3D images. 

The end goal is to also have a matching PCB layout which together with the schmatic will be useful for 
troubleshooting and repairing these retro computers. (This is a work in progress as its a lot of working trying to get a matching PCB Layout)

Is anyone has a empty (all components removed) or dead Commodore Plus 4 motherboard they want to donate (Or even has high res photos of a blank board) please get in touch with me. Its going to be difficult to get the exact layout with a component populated board.
