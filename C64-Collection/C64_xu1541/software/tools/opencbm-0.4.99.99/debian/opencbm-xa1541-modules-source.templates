Default: false
_Description: Use direct parallel port access?
 By default, /dev/cbm attaches itself to the Linux parport subsystem, which
 was introduced in the 2.2.x kernel series. If you don't want to use the
 parport system you can say yes here, and /dev/cbm will access the port
 directly.
 .
 If you're compiling for 2.0.x, this flag is entirely ignored.
