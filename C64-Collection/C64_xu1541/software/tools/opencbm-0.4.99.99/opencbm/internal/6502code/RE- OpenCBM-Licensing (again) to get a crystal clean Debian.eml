Hi guys,

My intentions with the strict license were to not allow people to make (dir=
ectly or indirectly) profit from my work; that's one thing I'd really hate =
to see. (On a side note: see that ramswell guy on comp.sys.cbm for an excel=
lent example of a person I wouldn't like to see touch my work at all!) But =
you're right, nobody gives a fuck about Commodore stuff anymore, :-( or :-)=
 so it doesn't make much sense to be so strict about it. It would be nice i=
f _I_ could release the full source of the Commander under GPL or some othe=
r similar free license but my hands are tied because of the inclusion of Tu=
rbo Vision - Turbo/Borland Pascal's text-based UI, which I heavily modified=
, though - that has still not been released by Inprise, although I've been =
bombarding them with a request every few years. :-( However, I'm very happy=
 when a benevolent person can/is willing to make use of my work so I'd like=
 to help in any way possible to allow him or her to.

As Spiro also mentioned, "returning" code developed by others into the Comm=
ander would be impossible with a GPL license on the other side, if no speci=
al permissions are added. I don't think this should be such a big problem a=
s I 1) am a lone wolf and prefer my own solutions to others, ;-) 2) I don't=
 mind if someone is not helpful (see the "fucks go to" part in the Star LFN=
 docs) and 3) I think, if needed, I could persuade the author of the other =
software, as a suggestion for cooperation resulting in a win-win situation,=
 anyway.

Please, feel free to include ANY part of the Commander in your software und=
er ANY free software license, whichever you see fit. I don't care; I mean a=
bout the _license_. (For further help, I've uploaded the partially disassem=
bled but heavily commented version of the disk turbos to http://sta.c64.org=
/scalpha/scdrvprg.zip . As you may know, I'm coding them in a monitor so th=
ere was no assembly source of them before. Please, don't use them as they a=
re because they may not even work, the disassembly is not finished yet. I d=
on't use them either: the process is going backwards, from the object code =
I use to the source code I create. Apart from this, they're all yours, too.=
)

If you feel pressed about having to choose a free software license you don'=
t like 100%, ONLY because of the Commander, then don't do it: I understand =
that, in the long run, everyone benefits from an as free as possible licens=
e rather than my stubborness and quite one-sided view of the world. ;-) Als=
o, if you have some ideas to make the Commander's own license more free, do=
n't hesitate to tell me. (Again, on a side note: I'm currently coding littl=
e programs in C under Windows, using MinGW, that are custom pipe stages or =
some other small, efficient and interesting pieces of software. I'm working=
 on some documentations, too. These are all NOT Commodore-related, neverthe=
less are things nobody seems to have done before, have heavily commented so=
urce and a common routine library and - at least, according to my plans - w=
ill be released into the public domain, without any restriction. I think th=
ese, as well as reading a 800-page book from 1965 about the basics of commu=
nism a few years ago, helped with understanding that any kind of such "arti=
ficial" restriction is per se stupid. ;-) And, as you may also remember, I =
was _never_ against helping fellow Commodore developers.)

> The next generation formatter was rewritten by me from scratch. Because I=
 couldn't write the new formatter without knowledge of the old code, I also=
 added all "indirect authors" into the copyright statements.

You can't steal _ideas_. ;-) I'm sure there's code in Star LFN similar to t=
he code whose copyright holder I sent to hell (see above) but that means no=
thing. How can you measure similarity (some kind of numeric correlation? co=
mputed how? diff length?) and at what percentage of similarity can you cons=
ider codes "the same" and sue the other's author? Bye,

Joe
