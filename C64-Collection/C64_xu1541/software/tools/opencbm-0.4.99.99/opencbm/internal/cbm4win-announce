Hello,

I'm proud to announce the availability of cbm4win, version 0.1.0 (first
public release).


What is cbm4win?

   cbm4win is a port of cbm4linux [1] to Windows. It allows for access
   to a VIC 1540, 1541, 1570, 1571, or even 1581 floppy drive from the
   PC on Windows NT, 2000 and XP.


Which operating systems are supported?

   Currently, there is support for Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, 
   Windows XP, and Windows 2003 Server. Previous versions of NT have
   not been tested, but they might work, too.
   

Is Windows 95, 98 or Me supported?

   No, there is currently no support for these Windows versions.
   Anyway, support for Windows 98 Second Edition and Me is planned.
   I do not know if it will be possible to port it to Windows 98 First
   Edition, though.


What can I do with cbm4win?

   The most important things you can do is to copy D64 or D71 images
   from a real drive to the PC, or from the PC to a real drive with the
   help of d64copy.
   Furthermore, you can copy single files in both directions, too.
   Some more tools (for example, cbmctrl) are given, too.


Is there 3rd party support for cbm4win?

   VICE [2] will have support for cbm4win in the next version. There is an
   internal version of YAPE [3] which supports cbm4win, too.
   Other people have already showed interest in supporting cbm4win in
   their products, too.


What is the development state of cbm4win?

   This is the first public announcement of cbm4win. Because of this,
   there is high probability that there are still errors.


What hardware is needed in order to use cbm4win?

  Of course, you need a PC running Windows NT, 2000, XP, or 2003.
  Furthermore, you need a real drive, like the VIC 1540, 1541, 1570,
  1571, or 1581 (1581 not fully supported). Then, you need an XA1541,
  XM1541, XAP1541 or XMP1541 cable in order to connect the driver with
  the PC.


Acknowledgements and Thanks

  Cbm4win is heavily based on cbm4linux [1], written by Michael Klein.
  Cbm4linux itself uses work from Star Commander [4], written by KOVÁCS
  Balázs a.k.a. "Joe Forster". I like to thank both for their steady
  help and their patience.

  Furthermore, I want to thank the following people:
  - Michael Klein for cbm4linux and many discussions. I do not know if I
    would have started this project without this.
  - KOVÁCS Balázs a.k.a. "Joe Forster" for Star Commander, his advice,
    and for giving me cables for free to work on this project;
  - Wolfgang Moser for steady discussions, testing, and bug reports, as
    well as giving me some more needed equipment;
  - all of my testers for steady tests, reports, and discussions.
