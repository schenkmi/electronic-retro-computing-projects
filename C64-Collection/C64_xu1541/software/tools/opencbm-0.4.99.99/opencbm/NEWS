These are the NEWS for cbm4linux ONLY!

This file is discontinued, look in the documentation instead (see first
point for version 0.4.0)

version 0.4.0:
- cbm4win and cbm4linux have been re-joined to opencbm; for the NEWS,
  have a look at the documentation (http://opencbm.trikaliotis.net/,
  or with "info opencbm").

version 0.3.3 (NEVER RELEASED!)
- documentation in --help for d64copy and cbmcopy fixed: now, it is clearly
  stated that a XP cable must be used in combination with a serial cable, not
  as only one.  (Spiro Trikaliotis)
- fixed crash with unkown long options in d64copy, cbmformat and maybe cbmcopy
  (Spiro Trikaliotis)
- "cbmctrl upload" accepts "-" as filename now (read from stdin)
- "cbmctrl download" takes optionally a file name argument (Spiro Trikaliotis)
- libd64copy failed to recognize .d71 images as valid images. Because of this,
  you could not write a .d71 image back to a real floppy drive
- d64copy: If you copy a disk to an image which already exists, the error
  information was not removed from the file if necessary. This is fixed now.
  (Spiro Trikaliotis)
- libd64copy: Fixed a crash on exit of d64copy if a .d64 file grows.
- parport_enumerate()-fix for kernels>=2.6.4
- new ioctl CBMCTRL_CLEAR_EOI and API function cbm_clear_eoi() (Robert Norris)
- minor (still compatible) API changes (Spiro Trikaliotis)
- cbmformat: make sure disk name is 0-terminated (Spiro Trikaliotis)

version 0.3.2:
- we're debianized now
- reset line can now be controlled through cbm_iec_{set,release}
- prepared for the 2.6 kernel series
- new module parameter 'hold_clk'
- cbmcopy hang-at-exit-bug fixed
- gcc 3.3 fixes (Count Zero, Andreas Boose)
- RPM .spec file tweaks (allows for non-root build)
- 1571 w/ XP1571 hang fixed
- cbm{copy,read,write} didn't understand '-f' ('--file-type' works, though)
  (reported by Ullrich von Bassewitz)

version 0.3.1:
- a few compilation fixes for various distros (RH 7.1, slackware 8.0,
  SuSE 7.3) by me and Kees Jongenburger

version 0.3.0:

- the fast file copier (cbmcopy/cbmread/cbmwrite) for 1541/1570/1571/1581
  drives has landed.

- libopencbm is a shared library now and contains most of the d64copy and
  cbmwrite code
- an experimental perl API has arrived
- d64copy handles error information
- support for odd-sized .d64 images in d64copy
- head movement optimization for 1571 in double double sided mode
- better error handling in d64copy

  Both files get installed systemwide in $(INCDIR) resp. $(LIBDIR)
- `xa´ not mandatory any more, as suggested by Ullrich von Bassewitz.
  Preassembled 6502 binaries included.
- (Forgotten) device locking added. Pointed out by Ullrich von Bassewitz.
- kernel module: #include <linux/config.h> and <linux/modversions.h> (the
  latter one #ifdef CONFIG_MODVERSION)
- default interleave values increased by one, should be more reasonable now
