Welcome to Project 64!

The goal of Project 64 is to preserve Commodore 64 related documents
in electronic text format that might otherwise cease to exist with the
rapid advancement of computer technology and declining interest in 8-
bit computers on the part of the general population. If you would like
to help by converting C64 related hardcopy documents to electronic
texts please contact the manager of Project 64, Cris Berneburg, at
74171.2136@compuserve.com.

Extensive efforts were made to preserve the contents of the original
document.  However, certain portions, such as diagrams, program
listings, and indexes may have been either altered or sacrificed due
to the limitations of plain vanilla text.  Diagrams may have been
eliminated where ASCII-art was not feasible.  Program listings may be
missing display codes where substitutions were not possible.  Tables
of contents and indexes may have been changed from page number
references to section number references. Please accept our apologies
for these limitations, alterations, and possible omissions.

About this manual

Basically, this manual is divided into two parts.  The first part
includes the introduction,  mouse cleaning,  and tips for general
care  of  the  mouse.  That  part  is  for  the  user with mouse-
compatible  software,  who  wants simply to plug in the mouse and
begin   using   it.  The  second  part  of  the  manual  contains
information  needed  by  those  who  wish to develop software for
the mouse.

1. USING THE MOUSE


Introduction

The  Commodore  1351  Mouse(TM)  is a controller designed for use
with  the  Commodore 64(R)  or  Commodore 128(TM)  computers.  It
features two buttons on the top, and a ball on the underside that
is rolled upon a flat surface to manipulate onscreen activity.

The  mouse  has  two  modes  of  operation  --  joystick mode and
proportional mode.

In  joystick  mode,  the  mouse  emulates  a  joystick and can be
used  with all joystick-compatible  software.  In this mode,  the
left  button  is  the fire button and the right button is usually
ignored.

In   proportional  mode,  the  mouse  uses  a  new  technique  to
communicate   mouse   movement  to  the  controlling  application
software.  That requires  the software to know the mouse is there
and  how to read it.  For example,  the GEOS(TM) operating system
can  use  many  different  input  drivers.  One  of  them  is the
Commodore  Mouse  driver,  which  can  be  used  with the 1351 in
proportional mode.

The  1351  provides a proportional mode  so that applications can
have a fast,  responsive pointer that moves easily on the screen.
Joystick mode acts as a fallback for those for those applications
that don't have installable device drivers. You can therefore use
the mouse as a joystick for older software, and take advantage of
the   benefits   provided   by   proportional   mode  with  newer
applications.

The mouse automatically powers up in proportional mode. To choose
joystick mode,  plug  the  mouse into either joystick port on the
side  of  the  computer  and  hold  down the right button  as the
computer is powered up.


1.1. Mouse Cleaning

Since the ball of your mouse roll freely to accurately manipulate
the cursor  (or whatever) on the screen,  it's important that the
ball remains free of dirt or debris.  This is easily accomplished
by sliding out the plastic piece holding the ball in place.

[ Pictures omitted ]

Remove  the  ball  and  wipe  it off with a soft cloth, such as a
handkerchief.

[ Picture omitted ]

To remove any dirt or dust  from the ball area,  just blow gently
into the opening.  Around the top of the opening, there are three
metal rollers. To clean these, take cotton-tipped swab, moistened
with head cleaning fluid or alcohol, and gently clean the surface
of each roller.  Replace the ball inside the controller  and snap
the plastic piece back on.

[ Picture omitted ]


1.2. Mouse Tips

Proper care and use of your mouse requires common sense.

Use your mouse on a clean, smooth surface.

Make  sure  you  have  adequate  desktop space to manipulate your
mouse, so you don't have to constantly pick up and reposition it.

Don't  hold  the mouse by its cord,  or let the body of the mouse
hang off the table.



2. PROPORTIONAL MOUSE DEVELOPER'S GUIDE

This  section  explains  the theory of operation of the Commodore
1351 mouse  and  suggests  ways  in which it can be interfaced to
applications or software.


2.1. Introduction

The  Commodore 1351 mouse  for use with the C64/C128 product line
is a small two-button device  which is connected to either of the
joystick ports on the C64/C128.

The mouse supports two distinct operating modes:
1) Joystick mode.
2) Proportional mode.

Proportional  mode  is  usable  with  the  C64  or the C128,  and
requires  a  special  machine  language  driver  to yield optimum
performance.

Mode selection is determined when the mouse is powered up. If the
user  depresses the right mouse button when the device is powered
up, then the mouse will be in joystick mode.

If  the  user  does  not  depress the right mouse button when the
device is powered up, then the mouse will default to proportional
mode.

Joystick  mode allows you to utilize the mouse as a joystick when
using software which does not support proportional mode.


2.2. Joystick Mode

In joystick mode the mouse operates as follows:
1) If the mouse is moved, then the appropriate joystick lines are
   activated for a period of 20 ms. Thus moving the mouse is like
   pushing the joystick in the appropriate direction.
2) The  left  mouse  button  is  mapped to what would be the fire
   button on a joystick.
3) The  right  mouse button is mapped into the SID POTX register.
   If  the  button  is depressed  then the SID POTX register will
   contain a number <$80. If the button is not depressed then SID
   POTX will contain a number >=$80.
4) See the section on SID Register Cautions.

Software Interface

For  most  applications,  the  interface for joystick mode should
be  just  as  any joystick driver, and the right button should be
ignored.


2.3. Proportional Mode

In proportional mode the mouse operates as follows:
1) Mouse  movement  is  tracked internally within the mouse.  The
   position of the mouse MOD 64  is  transmitted to the SID  POTX
   and  POTY  registers  every  512  microsecond  and requires no
   software intervention.
   The  POTX  register  is  used  to read X position of the mouse
   and the POTY register is used to read Y position of the mouse.
   The register contents are as follows:

                    +-------------------------------+
   Bit Position     | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
                    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   POT Register     | X | P5| P4| P3| P2| P1| P0| N |
                    +-------------------------------+
   where:
        X ......... is a don't care bit.
        P5-P0 ..... is the mouse position MOD 64.
        N ......... is a special (noise) bit (keep reading...).

2) The  left  mouse  button  is  mapped to what would be the fire
   button on a joystick.
3) The  right  mouse  button  is  mapped to what would be that UP
   direction on a joystick.

Software Interface

1) Because  the  left and right buttons appear as joystick lines,
   reading  them  from  software is a simple exercise in polling.
   Note that as with a joystick,  the buttons will interfere with
   the  keyboard  map,  and  software  should make some effort to
   distinguish between point short in the keyboard matrix  (i.e.,
   a  key  being  depressed),  and  a  whole  row or column being
   grounded (i.e., a joystick type of signal).
2) The  position information is not difficult to handle.  Ideally
   is  should be installed as part of the 60 Hz interrupt routine
   (preferably  at  the  beginning  --  see  the  section  on SID
   Register Cautions).
   This strategy is as follows:
   1) Read the mouse position MOD 64.
   2) Determine  if  the mouse has moved by comparing the current
      position with a saved copy of the previous position.
   3) If  the mouse has moved,  then modify your pointer position
      appropriately.
      You  should  note,  that even if the mouse is still,  it is
      possible for the POT register  to oscillate between $80 and
      $7F.  This  would result in the mouse position as jittering
      between two points.

In  order  to  ascertain  whether  the mouse has moved the software
should read the low order bit of the POT register.

All of this can be seen in the supplied mouse driver code.


2.4. SID Register Cautions

In  the  C64 & C128,  the  SID  POT  lines  are connected to both
joystick  ports.  A 4066 analog switch is used  to switch the POT
lines  between  the  two  ports based on one of the keyboard scan
lines.  This  means that the normal keyscan interrupt temporarily
affects the values returned in the POT registers.  Therefore,  in
order  to  perform  reliable  conversions,  the POT lines must be
connected  to  the mouse for a period >1.6 millisecond before the
value in the POT register is valid.

The best way to insure this is to wedge the mouse driver software
into the IRQ handler prior  to the polled keyscan.  This more-or-
less assures that the keyscan lines have been sufficiently stable
before the POT register is read by the mouse drivers.
